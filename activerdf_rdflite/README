Lua RDFLite adapter

Lua RDFLite is a small RDF datastore, based on sqlite3. Its a Lua version of rdflite for ruby. 
It can be used as a  datastore for Lua ActiveRDF: it acts as a adapter for ActiveRDF. 
Lua RDFLite does not scale well for large datasets, but is very fast for small ones. 
It supports the full ActiveRDF query grammar (basically, select/distinct/count with 
arbitrary joins in the where clauses). Unlike ruby rdflite Lua RDFLite does not offers 
full-text search over the literals yet. 

Lua RDFLite adapter is distributed as a Lua module.

Lua RDFLite SPARQL adapter is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1.

Current version is 0.1. It was developed for Lua 5.1.
