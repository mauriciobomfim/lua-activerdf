== Welcome to rdflite

rdflite is a small RDF datastore, based on sqlite3. It can be used as a 
datastore for ActiveRDF: it acts as a gemplugin for ActiveRDF. rdflite does not 
scale well for large datasets, but is very fast for small ones. It supports the 
full ActiveRDF query grammar (basically, select/distinct/count with arbitrary 
joins in the where clauses) and offers full-text search over the literals if 
ferret is installed. 

See http://www.activerdf.org/ for more information.
