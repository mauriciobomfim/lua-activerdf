Lua ActiveRDF
(http://activerdf.luaforge.net/)

Lua ActiveRDF is a library for accessing RDF data from Lua programs. 
In fact, Lua ActiveRDF is a Lua version of ActiveRDF (www.activerdf.org) for Ruby.
ActiveRDF allows you to rapidly create semantic applications.
ActiveRDF gives you a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for your RDF model: you can 
address RDF resources, classes, properties, etc. programmatically, without queries.

Simple Example
--------------
The following example uses a SPARQL endpoint with FOAF data and displays all 
people found in the data source:

	require 'activerdf'
	local cp = activerdf.ConnectionPool
	cp.add_data_source { type = 'sparql', engine = 'virtuoso', url = '...' }
	
	local ns = activerdf.Namespace
	local foaf = ns.register ( 'foaf', 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/' )
	
	local people = foaf.Person:find_all()
	for _, person in ipairs(people) do
		print(person.nick)
	end
