Lua ActiveRDF
(http://activerdf.luaforge.net/)

Lua ActiveRDF is a library for accessing RDF data from Lua programs. 
In fact, Lua ActiveRDF is a Lua version of ActiveRDF (www.activerdf.org) for Ruby.
Lua ActiveRDF allows you to rapidly create semantic web applications.
Lua ActiveRDF gives you a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for your RDF model: you can 
address RDF resources, classes, properties, etc. programmatically, without queries.

Simple Example
--------------
The following example uses a SPARQL endpoint and displays all 
people found in the data source:

	rdf = require 'activerdf'
	url = 'http://tecweb08.tecweb.inf.puc-rio.br:8890/sparql'
	rdf.ConnectionPool.add_data_source { type = 'sparql', engine = 'virtuoso', url = url }
	
	foaf = rdf.Namespace.register ( 'test', 'http://activerdf.luaforge.net/test/' )
	
	people = foaf.Person:find_all()
	for _, person in ipairs(people) do
		print(person.name)
	end
